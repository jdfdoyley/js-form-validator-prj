# Vanilla JavaScript - Form Validation Project

In this project, I meticulously crafted a user registration form, employing HTML and CSS for its structure and styling. The form's functionality is further enhanced with JavaScript, which I used to implement robust form validation. This project is exclusively focused on JavaScript, showcasing its versatility and power in web development.

This endeavor is a part of my ongoing learning journey with the [20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) course on Udemy, instructed by the renowned web developer [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/). Through this course, I am gaining hands-on experience in building practical web applications using only vanilla JavaScript, sharpening my skills in front-end development."

## Overview

### The Project

This project focuses on creating an interactive and user-friendly form interface. It aims to provide immediate visual feedback to users based on their interactions and input. The following features are integral to this project:

1. **Active State Visualization**:

    - When a user clicks into a textbox, it should visibly indicate an 'active' state. This can be achieved through a distinct visual change, such as a change in background color or a border highlight.

2. **Validation Feedback for Text Inputs**:

    - If a textbox contains text, it should display a green outline to signify valid input. This is especially crucial for the email field, where the text should conform to a valid email format.

    - In the case of the email field, the green outline should only appear if the entered text follows a standard email format.

3. **Error Handling and Messaging**:

    - If a required field is left blank upon clicking the 'submit' button, the user should receive a clear and concise error message, indicating the need to fill out the mandatory field.

    - For the email field, if the entered format is incorrect, an error message should appear, specifying the need for a valid email format.

4. **Visual Error Indicators**:

    - Any textbox with missing or invalid data should be highlighted with a red outline.

    - Alongside the red outline, a red text error message should appear, offering specific guidance on how to correct the input.

These features aim to enhance the user experience by providing immediate and intuitive feedback on their interactions with the form, thereby making the form more accessible and user-friendly.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My Process

### Built With

This project was meticulously constructed using a range of front-end technologies, ensuring both functionality and visual appeal:

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup**: Employed to structure the content in a meaningful, accessible, and SEO-friendly manner.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Utilized for efficient styling, allowing for a more dynamic and maintainable codebase.
- **Flexbox**: Implemented for a responsive and fluid layout, ensuring the design adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity to the web components, enhancing user experience through client-side scripting.

### What I Learned

While this project primarily served as a refresher, it reinforced my understanding and proficiency in foundational web development concepts. It was a valuable exercise in revisiting and consolidating my skills in HTML5, CSS, Flexbox, and JavaScript. This process helped me in:

- Sharpening my problem-solving and debugging skills.
- Improving my code structuring and organization for better readability and maintenance.
- Reinforcing best practices in responsive design and interactive web elements.
- Enhancing my ability to implement functionalities using pure JavaScript without relying on frameworks or libraries.

This project was a testament to the importance of mastering the basics, as they form the bedrock of more advanced web development skills.

### Continued Development

As I progress in my journey as a developer, I have identified key areas for growth and improvement in my upcoming projects:

1. **Mastery of Higher-Order Array Functions**: A primary focus will be on deepening my understanding and usage of higher-order array functions in JavaScript. I aim to gain more confidence in leveraging these functions for efficient data manipulation and complex operations, thereby enhancing the functionality and sophistication of my code.

2. **Code Organization and Structure**: I intend to dedicate more attention to the organization of my code. This involves adopting best practices in structuring and segmenting code to make it more modular, maintainable, and understandable.

3. **Enhancing Code Robustness**: Improving the robustness of my code is a key goal. This includes writing code that is not only functional but also resilient to bugs and errors, ensuring that my applications run smoothly under various scenarios and conditions.

4. **Optimization for Readability, Speed, and Flow**: Another area of focus will be on optimizing my code for readability, ensuring that it is easily understandable by other developers. Additionally, I plan to concentrate on enhancing the speed and performance of my applications, as well as the logical flow of my code, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

Through these focused efforts, I aim to evolve as a developer, creating more sophisticated, efficient, and high-quality applications. These improvements will not only benefit my personal growth but also contribute to the quality of projects I work on, ultimately delivering better experiences to end-users.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN JavaScript Regular Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) - This helped me gain a better understanding of Regular Expression and how to right them.I have used RegEx before but everytime I have use them, I like getting a quick refresher on their usage prior to writing them.

- [MDN JavaScript forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) - This helped with refreshing me on how to use Array.prototype.forEach() method.
